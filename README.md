# Covid19-Detection-from-ChestXRayImages :mask: :mask:
 
In this notebook, we examine covid-19 infection with the help of convolutional neural network and chest x-ray images.

Dataset images are divided into two classes:
* covid  (25 images) :disappointed_relieved:
* normal (25 images) :relieved:

I used **VGG16** in **keras** to categorize the images of these two classes, the structure of this network can be seen below:

Using this ready-made network and without adding any other convolution layer, I reached **100%** accuracy after 25 epochs. :sunglasses: :heart_eyes: :smiley:
