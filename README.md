# Covid19-Detection-from-ChestXRayImages

In this notebook, we examine covid-19 infection with the help of convolutional neural network and chest x-ray images.

Dataset images are divided into two classes:
* covid(25 images)
* normal(25 images)

I used VGG16 in keras to categorize the images of these two classes, the structure of this network can be seen below:

Using this ready-made network and without adding any other convolution layer, I reached **80%** accuracy after 20 epochs.
